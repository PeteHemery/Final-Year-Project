hartley transform reference number is wrong. (says XII but is XI in the reference section) Reset references?

or replace the hard coded values with dynamically assigned pointers passed from 
a
calling method.

The solution involves checking if the current sample is above the preset threshold. The variables used are:
counting and complete flags, window begin and signal start time clock values and a cycles counter. (Possibly more commas)?
The value of clock register is saved at the beginning of each new window. When a new signal that
is
 above a preset threshold is detected the value of the clock register is saved.


One problem is that if there is a background noise that doesnâ€™t allow the detected signal to fall below the
threshold before the note has finished. The total average of frequency estimation changes to encompass the
background noise and accuracy is lost.
(Should it be a semi-colon, or a comma?)
